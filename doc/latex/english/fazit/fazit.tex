\section{Systematic Contradictions of Established Theories and Their Resolution by the WDBT}
\subsection{Contradictions of GR}
\gls{art} stands on shaky ground – its central postulates, upon closer inspection, reveal themselves as mathematical fictions without physical basis.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Singularities:} The theory's bankruptcy\\\gls{art} predicts points of infinite density in black holes and the Big Bang – a clear violation of all physical principles. While \gls{art} capitulates here, \gls{wdbt} resolves this via the quantum potential $Q$, which acts repulsively at small distances, preventing singularities (Eq. \refeq{eq:wg-dbt-q}).
    \item \textbf{Dark Matter:} The invented lifeline\\For decades, physics has chased "dark matter" to explain discrepancies between \gls{art} predictions and observed galaxy rotations. \gls{wdbt} renders this crutch unnecessary: the fractal space structure and quantum potential naturally explain rotation curves (Eq. \refeq{eq:rotationskurve}).
    \item \textbf{Spacetime Curvature:} A metaphysical construct\\\gls{art} describes gravity as curvature of an abstract spacetime but fails to explain how matter causes this curvature. \gls{wdbt} replaces this mystique with direct Weber interactions between masses (Eq. \refeq{eq:wg-beta}) – a physically interpretable force.
    \item \textbf{Locality Dogma vs. Quantum Reality}\\While \gls{art} demands strict locality, quantum experiments (\gls{epr}, Bell tests) unequivocally show non-local correlations. \gls{wdbt} integrates these effects via the quantum potential, which acts instantaneously without violating causality.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Contradictions of Maxwell Theory}
Classical electrodynamics is similarly riddled with fundamental inconsistencies, systematically glossed over in textbooks.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Self-Energy Catastrophe}\\\gls{mt} predicts infinite self-energy for point charges – a telltale sign that the field concept reaches its limits. Weber electrodynamics elegantly bypasses this: by eliminating fields, it avoids divergent energies.
    \item \textbf{The Radiation Damping Paradox}\\\gls{mt} states that all accelerated charges must radiate – so why don’t electrons in a uniform gravitational field? Weber theory solves this: radiation occurs only during relative acceleration between charges (Eq. \refeq{eq:weber-em-damp}).
    \item \textbf{The Aharonov-Bohm Effect:} The end of the field dogma\\Experiments show quantum particles influenced by the vector potential $\vec{A}$ – even in regions with no electromagnetic field. This refutes the MT view that only $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are physically real. Weber electrodynamics dispenses with potentials entirely, explaining effects via direct charge interactions.
    \item \textbf{Virtual Particles:} The grand illusion\\\gls{qed} introduces "virtual photons" that seemingly interact faster than light – a blatant violation of relativity, masked as a "path integral trick." Weber electrodynamics proves such constructs unnecessary when allowing direct, velocity-dependent interactions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Hypocrisy of the Establishment}
The double standards of mainstream physics are glaring:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Allowed for GR/MT:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Infinities (singularities, self-energies).
        \item Invented entities (dark matter, virtual particles).
        \item Contradictions with quantum mechanics (locality problem).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Forbidden for WDBT:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Any deviation from the field paradigm – despite experimental anomalies.
        \item Demands for mechanistic explanations ("How does mass curve spacetime?").
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Meanwhile, researchers like David Bohm or André Koch Torres Assis are systematically marginalized – not because their theories are wrong, but because they threaten the power structure of mainstream physics.

\subsection{The Path to Scientific Revolution}
These contradictions are no trifles – they prove \gls{art} and \gls{mt} are fundamentally incomplete. \gls{wdbt} offers not just solutions but a coherent alternative:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No singularities (thanks to quantum potential).
    \item No dark matter (via fractal space structure).
    \item No fields (direct interactions).
\end{itemize}
It’s time to state this truth plainly: the established theories have failed – \gls{wdbt} is the way forward.
