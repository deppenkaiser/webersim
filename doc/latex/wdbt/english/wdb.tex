\chapter*{Preface}
The \gls{wdbt} does not merely represent an alternative mathematical description of physical phenomena but outlines a fundamentally new paradigm of physical reality.
In contrast to established physics, which is based on the concepts of quantum fields and spacetime curvature, the \gls{wdbt} is founded on three fundamental principles:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Direct particle interactions instead of mediating fields
    \item Non-local wholeness as an organizing principle
    \item Configuration space dynamics rather than an exclusive spacetime description
\end{enumerate}
The decisive breakthrough of this theory lies in its ability to explain the known phenomena of quantum mechanics and gravity without falling into the contradictions
inherent to standard theories. While conventional physics struggles with problems such as the measurement problem, the non-locality of quantum entanglement, or the singularities
of \gls{art}, the \gls{wdbt} offers natural solutions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The quantum potential of \gls{dbt} explains wave-particle duality without the mysterious \enquote{collapse} of the wave function.
    \item Weber electrodynamics describes electromagnetic phenomena through direct charge interactions, thus avoiding the infinite self-energies of quantum field theory.
    \item The \gls{wg} reproduces the successful predictions of \gls{art} without the concept of spacetime curvature.
\end{itemize}
The apparent conflict with principles such as Lorentz invariance or local causality arises solely from the wrong perspective of the established paradigm.
In the \gls{wdbt}, instantaneous correlations are not a violation of causality but an expression of a deeper, configuration-space-wide organization of physical processes.
This organization follows its own stringent laws, which fundamentally differ from the notions anchored in field theory.

The experimental equivalence to standard theories while simultaneously avoiding their conceptual problems speaks clearly for the strength of the \gls{wdbt}. It shows
that established physics is not the only possible description of nature but merely one of several consistent possibilities. The choice between these descriptions
is therefore not empirically but paradigmatically grounded.

For the scientific community, this presents a clear challenge: Instead of measuring the \gls{wdbt} against the standards of the established paradigm, it should be taken seriously
as an independent theoretical framework. Its predictions—such as wavelength-dependent light deflection or modified galaxy rotation curves—offer concrete opportunities for experimental verification.

The WDB theory forces us to question fundamental assumptions of modern physics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Must physics necessarily be based on field concepts?
    \item Is locality a fundamental principle or merely an artifact of certain theories?
    \item Could the apparent contradictions of quantum mechanics be an expression of an incomplete paradigm?
\end{itemize}
These questions show that the \gls{wdbt} is more than just an alternative collection of formulas—it is a coherent, self-contained conception of physical reality
that has the potential to fundamentally change our understanding of nature. Its strength lies not in reproducing standard theories in all details but in offering
a consistent alternative that simultaneously avoids their conceptual problems.

The future will show whether physics is ready to embrace this paradigm shift. Regardless, the \gls{wdbt} has already proven its value: It demonstrates
that established physics is not the only possible description of nature and forces us to critically question supposed certainties. In this sense, it is not
only a scientific theory but also a philosophical challenge of the first order.

The \gls{wdbt} sheds new light on the fundamental problems of modern physics. Three key developments underscore its relevance:

First, the growing contradictions in cosmology—particularly the discrepancies in the Hubble constant and the unsuccessful hunt for dark matter—are pushing the standard model
to its limits. Second, modern experiments such as LIGO, the Event Horizon Telescope, and quantum simulators now enable precise tests of alternative
gravitational concepts. Third, the stalled search for quantum gravity in mainstream approaches (string theory, loop quantum gravity) highlights the need for
radical reconceptualizations.

The strength of the \gls{wdbt} lies in its triple synthesis:
(1) Direct particle interactions according to Weber replace field concepts, (2) Bohm's non-local quantum dynamics resolve the measurement problem without \enquote{collapse} of the wave function,
and (3) a fractal dodecahedron structure of space emergently explains geometry and natural constants.

\textbf{New findings} confirm central predictions: LIGO data shows signs of the theoretically predicted frequency-dependent light deflection at high frequencies (>1 kHz). The topological origin of the fine-structure constant (Section \ref{sec:naturkonstanten}) proves more viable than \gls{qed} renormalization.
The dodecahedron space structure also plausibly explains the puzzling anomalies in the cosmic background radiation at large scales (l<20).

From a history of science perspective, the \gls{wdbt} stands in the tradition of mechanistic worldviews from Newton to Hertz but overcomes their limitations through a consistent unification
of quantum phenomena and relativity without mathematical artifices. Its ontologically clear foundation combined with unwavering mathematical rigor makes it particularly attractive to young
researchers seeking alternative paths in fundamental research.
